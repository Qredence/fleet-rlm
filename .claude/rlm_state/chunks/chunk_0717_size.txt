name: openapi-standard
description: Use when you need to create machine-readable REST API documentation, define endpoint contracts for tool-calling agents, or standardize service descriptions to prevent invalid API implementation and inconsistent client generation.

# OpenAPI Standard (OAS)

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is the industry-standard "Source of Truth" for RESTful APIs. It provides a formal, machine-readable contract that bridges the gap between backend implementation, frontend consumption, and automated tooling.

## Core Principle
**The API-First Contract:** The specification is not merely documentation; it is the definitive technical contract. Implementation MUST follow the spec, and the spec MUST be the single point of truth for generating clients, mocks, and validation logic.

## When to Use This Skill
- **Contract-First Development:** Before writing code, to align stakeholders on endpoint behavior.
- **AI Agent Integration:** Defining tools so LLMs can interact with your services via function calling.
- **Automated SDK Generation:** Producing typed clients for Python, TS, or Java automatically.
- **API Governance:** Standardizing response structures and security across multiple microservices.

## Quick Start
Create a file named `openapi.yaml` and paste the following baseline structure:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: User Service API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: API for managing user profiles and authentication.
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com/v1
    description: Production server
paths:
  /health:
    get:
      summary: Health check
      operationId: getHealth
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Service is healthy
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  status: { type: string, example: "ok" }
```

## 1. Document Structure
A valid OAS file consists of five primary pillars:
1. `openapi`: The version (3.0.x or 3.1.x).
2. `info`: Metadata (Title, Version, License).
3. `servers`: Target URLs for the API.
4. `paths`: The actual endpoints and HTTP methods.
5. `components`: Reusable objects (schemas, security schemes, parameters).

## 2. Defining Endpoints (Paths & Operations)
Each path is an object containing operations (HTTP methods).

### ❌ Anti-Pattern: Vague and Redundant
```yaml
paths:
  /get_user_by_id: # Don't put actions in paths
    get:
      operationId: user # Too vague
```

### ✅ Production Pattern: Resource-Oriented
```yaml
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a user by ID
      operationId: getUserById # Unique, camelCase
      parameters:
        - name: userId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
            format: uuid
      responses:
        '200':
          description: User found
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
```

## 3. Parameter Mapping & Validation
Parameters can live in `path`, `query`, `header`, or `cookie`. ALWAYS specify constraints to enable automatic validation.

```yaml
# Example: Paginated Search
get:
  parameters:
    - name: limit
      in: query
      description: Number of records to return
      schema:
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
        maximum: 100
        default: 20
    - name: offset
      in: query
      schema:
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
```

## 4. Reusable Components (DRY Principles)
NEVER define complex objects inline. Move them to `components/schemas` and use `$ref`. This ensures consistency across GET, POST, and PUT operations.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      required: [id, email]
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          format: uuid
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
        role:
          type: string
          enum: [admin, editor, viewer]
    Error:
      type: object
      properties:
        code: { type: integer }
        message: { type: string }
```

## Real-World Impact
- **Developer Experience:** Reduces onboarding time by 40% through interactive docs (Swagger UI).
- **Consistency:** Ensures 100% adherence to HTTP status code standards across teams.
- **AI Readiness:** Enables LLMs to execute complex tasks by providing structured JSON-schema tool definitions.
- **Reliability:** Catch 95% of malformed requests at the gateway level via schema validation.

## Validation & Linting
ALWAYS validate your spec before committing. Use the `spectral` linter for style and correctness.

```bash
# Install Spectral
npm install -g @stoplight/spectral-cli

# Run linting
spectral lint openapi.yaml
```

Checklist for valid OAS:
- [ ] No syntax errors (indentation is 2 spaces).
- [ ] All `operationId` values are unique.
- [ ] Every response has a description.
- [ ] Circular references are avoided in schemas.

name: async
description: Use when I/O-bound operations (network requests, database queries, file reads) cause application latency or when managing thousands of concurrent connections within a single thread. Symptoms include high wait times during network calls and underutilized CPU while waiting for external resources.
---

# Asynchronous Python (asyncio)

Asynchronous programming in Python is a paradigm for **cooperative multitasking**. Unlike threading, where the OS preempts tasks, `asyncio` allows tasks to explicitly yield control back to an "Event Loop" while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

**Core Principle:** NEVER block the event loop. If the loop is blocked by a CPU-heavy task or a synchronous I/O call, the entire application stops responding.

## When to Use

- **High I/O Wait Times:** Applications spending >50% of time waiting for DBs, APIs, or sockets.
- **Massive Concurrency:** Handling thousands of simultaneous WebSockets or HTTP connections where threads would consume too much memory.
- **Microservices:** Orchestrating multiple external service calls that can happen in parallel.

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def fetch_data(id: int, delay: int):
    print(f"Task {id} starting...")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)  # Yields control back to the loop
    return {"id": id, "data": f"Result {id}"}

async def main():
    # Modern Python 3.11+ Structured Concurrency
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        t1 = tg.create_task(fetch_data(1, 2))
        t2 = tg.create_task(fetch_data(2, 1))
    
    # TaskGroups ensure all tasks complete or fail together
    print(f"Results: {t1.result()}, {t2.result()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start = time.perf_counter()
    asyncio.run(main())
    print(f"Executed in {time.perf_counter() - start:.2f}s")
```

---

## Core Patterns

### 1. Parallel Execution vs. Sequential Waiting
ALWAYS use concurrent primitives when tasks are independent. NEVER await coroutines sequentially if they don't depend on each other.

❌ **Anti-Pattern: Sequential Await**
```python
# Takes 3 seconds
res1 = await get_api_a() # Waits 1s
res2 = await get_api_b() # Waits 2s
```

✅ **Production Pattern: TaskGroup (3.11+)**
```python
# Takes 2 seconds (the max of both)
async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
    task1 = tg.create_task(get_api_a())
    task2 = tg.create_task(get_api_b())
# Result access happens after the block
print(task1.result(), task2.result())
```

### 2. Timeouts and Deadlines
ALWAYS wrap external network calls in timeouts to prevent "Hanging Tasks."

❌ **Anti-Pattern: Infinite Wait**
```python
data = await socket.recv() # Might hang forever
```

✅ **Production Pattern: asyncio.wait_for**
```python
try:
    data = await asyncio.wait_for(socket.recv(), timeout=5.0)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print("Remote service timed out")
```

### 3. Non-Blocking Delays
NEVER use `time.sleep()` inside an `async def` function. It halts the entire thread.

❌ **Anti-Pattern: Blocking the Loop**
```python
async def poll():
    time.sleep(1) # THE ENTIRE APP STOPS HERE
```

✅ **Production Pattern: asyncio.sleep**
```python
async def poll():
    await asyncio.sleep(1) # Loop switches to other tasks
```

### 4. Safe Resource Management
ALWAYS use `async with` for objects that require cleanup (connections, files, sessions).

❌ **Anti-Pattern: Manual Close**
```python
client = AsyncClient()
data = await client.get()
await client.close() # Risk of leak if exception occurs
```

✅ **Production Pattern: Async Context Manager**
```python
async with AsyncClient() as client:
    data = await client.get()
# Automatically closed here
```

---

## Performance Hazards (Loop Blockers)

A single blocking call can degrade an async app to worse-than-sync performance. Watch for these "Hidden Blockers":

1.  **Synchronous DB Drivers:** Using `psycopg2` or `sqlite3` (use `asyncpg` or `aiosqlite`).
2.  **Requests Library:** `requests.get()` is blocking. Use `httpx` or `aiohttp`.
3.  **File I/O:** Standard `open().read()` is blocking. For high-throughput, use `aiofiles`.
4.  **CPU Bound Tasks:** Heavy math or image processing. Offload these to `loop.run_in_executor`.

---

## Real-World Impact

In a scenario fetching 100 metadata records from a remote API (100ms latency each):

| Method | Time | Resource Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Synchronous** | ~10.2 seconds | Low RAM, High Latency |
| **Multithreading** | ~0.5 seconds | High RAM (100 threads) |
| **Asyncio** | **~0.12 seconds** | **Minimal RAM (1 thread)** |

---

## Validation and Troubleshooting

### Validation Commands
Verify if your code is truly running concurrently by timing it:
```bash
# It should take roughly the time of the LONGEST task, not the SUM
time python my_async_script.py
```

### Debug Mode
Enable `PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG` to find where you are blocking the loop:
```bash
export PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1
python my_script.py
# Output will warn: "Executing <Task...> took 0.150 seconds"
```

### Common Fixes
- **"Coroutines was never awaited":** You called `func()` but forgot `await func()`.
- **"Event loop is closed":** You tried to run a task after `asyncio.run()` finished.
- **"AttributeError: __aenter__":** You used `with` instead of `async with` on an async resource.
