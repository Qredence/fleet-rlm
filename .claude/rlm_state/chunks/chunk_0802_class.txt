## Domain Services

Domain services contain business logic that doesn't naturally fit within a single entity.

```python
from skill_fleet.domain import (
    SkillDomainService,
    JobDomainService,
    TaxonomyDomainService,
)

# Skill Domain Service
skill_service = SkillDomainService(skill_repository)
can_publish = skill_service.can_publish(skill)
overlap_score = skill_service.calculate_overlap(skill1, skill2)

# Job Domain Service
job_service = JobDomainService(job_repository)
can_start = job_service.can_start(job)

# Taxonomy Domain Service
taxonomy_service = TaxonomyDomainService(taxonomy_repository)
path_exists = taxonomy_service.path_exists(taxonomy_path)
```

## Domain Events

Domain events represent something that happened in the domain that other parts of the system may need to react to.

```python
from skill_fleet.domain import SkillCreatedEvent, JobCompletedEvent
from datetime import datetime, UTC

# Skill created event
event = SkillCreatedEvent(
    event_id="evt-123",
    occurred_at=datetime.now(UTC),
    skill_id="python-async",
    taxonomy_path="python/async",
    user_id="user-456",
)

# Job completed event
event = JobCompletedEvent(
    event_id="evt-456",
    occurred_at=datetime.now(UTC),
    job_id="job-abc",
    status=JobStatus.COMPLETED,
    result=skill_result,
)
```

**Usage Pattern** (future enhancement):
```python
# In domain service
