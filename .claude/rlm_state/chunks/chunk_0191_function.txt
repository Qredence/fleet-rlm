## When to Abstract vs. When to Duplicate

### When to Abstract

✅ Same logic used in 3+ places
✅ Complex logic that benefits from naming
✅ Logic that changes frequently across the codebase
✅ Cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, auth)

### When to Duplicate

✅ Simple logic (1-2 lines) that's easier to read inline
✅ Context-specific behavior that might diverge
✅ Temporary code that will change soon
✅ Tests (each test should be independent)

**Example - OK to duplicate:**
```python
# Simple checks can be duplicated
if not user:
    return None

if not product:
    return None
```

**Example - Should abstract:**
```python
# Complex validation should be extracted
