def verify_system():
    result = test_skill.run()
    if "TEST_SUCCESSFUL" in result:
        print("Infrastructure is healthy.")
```

### Variable Mirroring
To verify that the input/output pipeline is intact, pass a probe value.

```python
# Expected Result: The same probe value returned in the response.
probe_value = "system_handshake_001"
result = test_skill.run(input_probe=probe_value)
assert probe_value in result
```

## Core Patterns

### 1. The Explicit Handshake
Every test execution MUST produce a unique, unambiguous success string.

*   ❌ **Anti-pattern**: Returning a generic `True` or empty string. This makes it impossible to distinguish between a successful run and a silent failure.
*   ✅ **Production Pattern**: Returning a structured message like `[STATUS: OK] Skill Pipeline Verified`.

### 2. Variable Mirroring (Echo)
A core failure mode is the truncation of input data or context. The test skill MUST be able to "mirror" inputs back to the caller.

*   ❌ **Anti-pattern**: Hard-coding a response that ignores user inputs.
*   ✅ **Production Pattern**: Capturing a `test_id` or `timestamp` from the input and including it in the output to prove end-to-end data integrity.

### 3. Deliberate Failure (Negative Testing)
To test the agent's error-handling capabilities, the test skill should support a flag to force a controlled exception.

*   ❌ **Anti-pattern**: Assuming that if the test skill passes, the error handler works.
*   ✅ **Production Pattern**: Using a `trigger_error=True` parameter to verify the system correctly catches, logs, and reports the exception without crashing the runtime.

## Contrast Patterns

| Feature | ✅ Recommended (Predictable) | ❌ Discouraged (Over-engineered) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dependencies** | None (Standard Library only) | Requests, Pandas, or external DBs |
| **Logic** | Identity functions (Input = Output) | Complex math or conditional branching |
| **Output** | Constant, grep-able strings | Dynamic, LLM-generated prose |
| **Speed** | Sub-100ms execution | Multi-second delays or retries |

## Real-World Impact

- **Reduced MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)**: By quickly isolating infrastructure issues, developers can skip hours of debugging business logic when the underlying problem is a broken environment variable or file permission.
- **Baseline Reliability**: Provides a "Heartbeat" mechanism for production monitors. If `test-skill` fails, the entire agent cluster should be considered "Down."
- **Standardized Onboarding**: New developers use `test-skill` as their first "Hello World" to confirm their local environment is correctly configured.

## Validation

To verify this skill is functional, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Check if the skill is recognized by the agent
agent-cli skills list | grep "test-skill"

# 2. Execute a smoke test with an input probe
agent-cli run test-skill --input "probe_123"

# 3. Expected Output Check:
# The output MUST contain: "SUCCESS" and "probe_123"
```

## Troubleshooting
If this skill fails, check the following in order:
1.  **File Permissions**: Ensure the agent has read/execute access to the `_core/test-skill` directory.
2.  **Manifest Integrity**: Validate that the `metadata.json` or YAML frontmatter follows the current version schema.
3.  **Resource Exhaustion**: Confirm the system has enough memory to spin up the runtime, as even a simple skill requires the base environment.

description: Use when UI components are fragmented across files, styles lack semantic meaning, or developer handoff causes friction due to 1:1 implementation gaps. This skill provides the architectural framework for building scalable libraries using variables, component properties, and auto-layout to ensure a single source of truth.

# Figma Design Systems Architecture

Design systems in Figma are not merely "UI Kits"—they are technical products that serve as the single source of truth for design and code. You MUST treat your Figma files as logic-driven frameworks, utilizing multi-tier variables and optimized component properties to ensure scalability and developer alignment.

## The Core Principle: Systems Over Assets
A design system is a language of logic, not a collection of parts. Every element must be governed by a **Token-First** philosophy. If a value (color, spacing, radius) exists in the UI, it MUST be tied to a semantic variable. Fragmented, hardcoded values are technical debt.

## When to Use
- **Scaling Product Teams:** Multiple designers working on different features requiring a shared language.
- **Multi-Brand/Multi-Platform:** Rebranding or supporting Light/Dark modes via a single component library.
- **Handoff Friction:** Developers are guessing spacing, hex codes, or component behavior during implementation.
- **Library Performance Issues:** Large Figma files are lagging due to excessive variants (Variant Bloat).

## Quick Start: The Systemic Setup

1.  **Initialize Variables:** Open Local Variables. Create a `Primitives` collection (e.g., `blue-500`) and a `Semantic` collection (e.g., `color-action-primary-default`). Map Primitives to Semantics.
2.  **Define Layout:** Set a grid and spacing scale (e.g., 4px or 8px base). Create variables for `spacing-xs`, `spacing-sm`, etc.
3.  **Construct Base Components:** Build an atom (e.g., a button label) using Auto Layout (`Shift + A`).
4.  **Apply Component Properties:** Add Text and Boolean properties to the component to handle logic without creating extra variants.
5.  **Publish:** Move the component to a dedicated "Components" library file and publish to the Team Library.

---

## Core Patterns

### 1. Multi-tier Variable Architecture (Tokens)
Variables provide the logic for themes (Light/Dark) and brands. ALWAYS use a three-tier system to decouple technical values from design intent.

| Tier | Purpose | Example Naming |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primitive** | Global raw values (Do not use in UI) | `color/blue/500`, `size/16` |
| **Semantic** | Intent-based aliases (Primary use in UI) | `bg/surface-primary`, `spacing/gap-md` |
| **Component** | Specific overrides (Used for overrides) | `button/bg-hover`, `header/height-fixed` |

**The Contrast:**
- ❌ **Legacy:** Selecting `#007BFF` directly or using a Style named "Blue 500."
- ✅ **Systematic:** Assigning the `action-primary-default` variable, which points to `blue-500`.

### 2. Component Construction: The Property-First Method
Variants create file bloat and performance lag. You MUST use Component Properties to manage state and content wherever possible.

**The Contrast:**
- ❌ **Anti-pattern:** Creating 24 variants of a button just to toggle an icon on/off or change text.
- ✅ **Production Pattern:** Use one variant with a **Boolean Property** for the icon visibility and a **Text Property** for the label. Use **Instance Swap** properties to allow icon changes without detaching.

### 3. The 'Slot' Component Pattern
For complex organisms (Modals, Sidebars, Cards), use "Slots" to maintain system integrity while allowing content flexibility.

- **Mechanism:** Create a placeholder component called `_internal/slot`. Inside your Modal component, place an instance of this slot. 
- **Usage:** In the consumer file, use the **Instance Swap** property to replace the slot with a specific content local component.

### 4. Library Architecture (Multi-file Strategy)
NEVER put foundations (colors, grids) and complex components (tables, modals) in the same file for large-scale systems.

- **Foundations File:** Primitives, Semantic Variables, Icons, Typography.
- **Components File:** Atoms and Molecules that consume the Foundations library.
- **Prototyping File:** Page-level layouts that consume the Components library.

---

## Real-World Impact: Design Ops Metrics
Implementing a Figma Design System creates measurable ROI:
- **Handoff Efficiency:** Reduction in "red-lining" time. Developers use Figma Dev Mode to see variable names that match CSS variables/Tailwind config.
- **Maintenance Speed:** Global updates (e.g., changing a brand color) take minutes instead of weeks across 100+ files.
- **Consistency:** Component adoption tracking (via Figma Analytics) ensures >90% of UI is built using system-owned components.

---

## Validation & Quality Audit

Before publishing any component or library update, run this checklist:

1.  **Variable Linkage:** Is every color, spacing, and radius value linked to a Semantic Variable? (Use the "Selection Colors" panel to check for "raw" hex codes).
2.  **Auto Layout:** Does the component respond correctly when the container is resized? (Test "Hug," "Fill," and "Fixed" settings).
3.  **Layer Naming:** Are layers named semantically (e.g., `Container` vs `Frame 5132`)?
4.  **Property Logic:** Are Boolean and Instance Swap properties used to reduce variant count by at least 50%?
5.  **Documentation:** Does the component have a description and a link to the functional spec (Jira/Storybook)?

**CLI/Tooling Audit (Advanced):**
If using a plugin like `Design Lint` or `Instance Health`:
```bash
# Conceptually: Validate Figma tokens against code
npx style-dictionary build --config config.json
# Ensure no 'orphaned' values exist in the JSON export
```

name: hello-world
description: Use when you need to verify the integrity of a new agent installation or require a minimal, functional template for bootstrapping new skill development. Triggers include initial setup validation, testing skill-loading mechanisms, or establishing a 'clean slate' for prototyping.

# Hello World: The Atomic Skill

The `hello-world` skill represents the minimal unit of agent capability. It serves as the baseline for system verification and the blueprint for all future skill development.

## Core Principle: The Atomic Skill
**A skill is not just code; it is a structured package of metadata, documentation, and logic.** The "Atomic Skill" principle dictates that even the simplest functionality must adhere to the standardized directory layout to be discoverable and executable by the Agentic System.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- **Validating Installation:** You have just installed the agent framework and need to confirm the environment is correctly configured.
- **Bootstrapping Development:** You are starting a new skill and need a "clean slate" template that follows current standards.
- **Testing Skill Loading:** You need to verify that the system can correctly parse `metadata.json` and index `SKILL.md`.
- **Debugging Paths:** You are troubleshooting directory permissions or skill discovery logic.

---

## Quick Start

To manually create the atomic skill, establish the following structure in your `skills/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p skills/_core/hello-world
touch skills/_core/hello-world/metadata.json
touch skills/_core/hello-world/SKILL.md
touch skills/_core/hello-world/main.py
```

### 1. Define the Manifest (`metadata.json`)
```json
{
  "skill_id": "_core/hello-world",
  "name": "hello-world",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "technical",
  "dependencies": ["_core/communication"]
}
```

### 2. Implement the Logic (`main.py`)
```python
