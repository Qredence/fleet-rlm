## 📊 Workflow Validation Checklist

Before considering this production-ready:

- [ ] **Taxonomy Integration Tests**
  - Skill paths resolve correctly
  - Dependencies are validated
  - No circular dependencies possible
  
- [ ] **Generation Quality**
  - Skills pass validation 90%+ of the time
  - Generated content matches templates
  - Examples are executable
  
- [ ] **Performance**
  - Full workflow completes in < 30 seconds
  - Cached lookups < 100ms
  - Parallel generation supported
  
- [ ] **HITL Efficiency**
  - Clear approval/rejection criteria
  - Feedback incorporates quickly (< 2 iterations avg)
  - Approval rate > 70% on first submission
  
- [ ] **Evolution Tracking**
  - Version history persisted
  - Usage analytics integrated
  - Auto-optimization triggers defined

---

## 🎯 Final Verdict

**Your approach is solid.** The key enhancements I recommend:

1. **Deep taxonomy integration** at every step (especially UNDERSTAND and PLAN)
2. **Dependency resolution** to prevent mounting issues
3. **Standardized structure** for automated validation
4. **Composition patterns** for skill relationships
5. **Evolution tracking** for continuous improvement

With these additions, you'll have a **production-grade skill creation system** that grows intelligently with your taxonomy.

The fact that you're thinking about progressive disclosure, degrees of freedom, and HITL approval shows you understand the hard parts. Execute on this plan and you'll have something exceptional. 🚀

# Progressive Implementation Strategy for Skills Taxonomy

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Bootstrap Model

Your instinct is correct - combining core structure with usage-based bootstrapping is the optimal path. Here's a phased implementation strategy:

## Phase 1: Minimal Viable Taxonomy (Week 1-2)

### Core Structure Setup
```
skills/
├── _core/                          # Always loaded
│   ├── reasoning.json
│   ├── communication.json
│   └── state_management.json
├── _templates/                     # Skill generation templates
│   ├── skill_template.json
│   ├── specialization_template.json
│   └── memory_block_template.json
├── cognitive_skills/
│   └── .gitkeep                    # Empty, ready for generation
├── technical_skills/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── domain_knowledge/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── tool_proficiency/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── mcp_capabilities/
│   ├── context_management.json     # Essential for stateful ops
│   ├── state_management.json
│   └── tool_integration.json
├── specializations/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── task_focus_areas/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── memory_blocks/
│   ├── project_context.json        # Essential for continuity
│   └── interaction_history.json
└── taxonomy_meta.json              # Taxonomy metadata & version
```

### Core Files Only
Start with these essential capabilities:

**_core/reasoning.json**
```json
{
  "skill_id": "core.reasoning",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "cognitive",
  "always_loaded": true,
  "capabilities": [
    "logical_inference",
    "problem_decomposition",
    "constraint_satisfaction"
  ],
  "dependencies": [],
  "weight": "lightweight"
}
```

**taxonomy_meta.json**
```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "last_updated": "2026-01-06",
  "total_skills": 3,
  "generation_count": 0,
  "usage_stats": {},
  "bootstrap_profiles": [
    "web_developer",
    "data_scientist",
    "devops_engineer",
    "general_purpose"
  ]
}
```
