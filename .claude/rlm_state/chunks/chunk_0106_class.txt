class TaskRouting(dspy.Signature):

### 5. Use Consistent Naming Conventions

- Input fields: `task_description`, `user_query`, `document_text`
- Output fields: `summary`, `analysis`, `recommendation`
- Lists: `subtasks`, `key_points`, `suggestions`
- Scores: `confidence_score`, `quality_score`, `relevance_score`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Ambiguous field descriptions

**Problem**: LLM doesn't understand what the field represents

**Solution**: Add specific examples and constraints
```python
# Before
summary = dspy.OutputField(desc="Summary")

# After
summary = dspy.OutputField(
    desc="Concise summary in 2-3 sentences, capturing main points"
)
```

### Issue: Missing type hints

**Problem**: DSPy can't validate data types

**Solution**: Add type hints to all fields
```python
# Before
suggestions = dspy.OutputField(desc="Suggestions")

# After
suggestions: List[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="List of suggestions")
```

### Issue: Too many outputs

**Problem**: Signature is doing too much

**Solution**: Split into multiple signatures
```python
# Before
