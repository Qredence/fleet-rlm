def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a city."""
    # In a real implementation, this would call a weather API
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny and 75°F"

# Create ReAct agent
react = dspy.ReAct(
    signature="question -> answer",
    tools=[get_weather],
    max_iters=5
)

# Use agent
result = react(question="What's the weather like in Tokyo?")
print(result.answer)
print("Tool calls made:", result.trajectory)
```

**Key components:**
- `signature`: Input/output structure for the agent
- `tools`: List of available tool functions
- `max_iters`: Maximum number of reasoning/action cycles

### ReAct with Multiple Tools

```python
# Define tools
