    """
    Create standard skill subdirectories with README.md files.

    Creates the following structure (v2 Golden Standard format):
    - references/README.md, quick-start.md, common-patterns.md, api-reference.md, troubleshooting.md
    - guides/README.md (formerly resources/)
    - templates/README.md
    - scripts/README.md
    - examples/README.md
    - tests/README.md
    - assets/README.md

    Legacy directories (capabilities/, resources/) are created for backward compatibility
    but new skills should use references/ and guides/ instead.

        skill_dir: Path to the skill directory
