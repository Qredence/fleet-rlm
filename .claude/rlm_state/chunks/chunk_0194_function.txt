### Batch Database Operations

**Good:**
```python
# Bulk insert
users = [User(name=name) for name in names]
session.bulk_save_objects(users)
session.commit()
```

**Bad:**
```python
# Individual inserts
for name in names:
    user = User(name=name)
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()  # Commits for each user!
```

## Security

### Never Trust User Input

```python
# Always validate and sanitize
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
