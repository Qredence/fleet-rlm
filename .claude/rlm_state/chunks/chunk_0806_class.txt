class TaxonomyRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_path(self, path: str) -> TaxonomyPath | None:
        pass
```

## Import Guidelines

```python
# Import all domain components from one place
from skill_fleet.domain import (
    # Models
    Skill,
    SkillMetadata,
    Job,
    JobStatus,
    TaxonomyPath,
    SkillType,
    # Specifications
    SkillIsReadyForPublication,
    JobCanBeStarted,
    AndSpecification,
    # Domain Services
    SkillDomainService,
    # Repository Interfaces
    SkillRepository,
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep domain logic pure**: Domain models should not depend on external services
2. **Use specifications for rules**: Business rules should be encapsulated in specifications
3. **Value objects are immutable**: They should not be modified after creation
4. **Entities have identity**: Entities are identified by their ID, not their attributes
5. **Domain services for cross-entity logic**: Logic that involves multiple entities goes in domain services

## Testing Domain Logic

```python
import pytest
from skill_fleet.domain import Skill, SkillMetadata, SkillIsReadyForPublication
