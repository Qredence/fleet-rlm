## Extended Metadata

While agentskills.io requires only `name` and `description`, skill-fleet stores extended metadata in the `metadata` field:

```yaml
---
name: python-decorators
description: Ability to design, implement
metadata:
  skill_id: technical_skills/programming/languages/python/decorators
  version: 1.0.0
  type: technical
  weight: medium
  load_priority: task_specific
---
```

### Extended Fields

These fields are specific to skill-fleet but don't violate the agentskills.io spec:

- **`skill_id`**: Internal path-style identifier
- **`version`**: Semantic version (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- **`type`**: Skill category (`cognitive`, `technical`, `domain`, etc.)
- **`weight`**: Resource intensity (`lightweight`, `medium`, `heavyweight`)
- **`load_priority`**: When to load (`always`, `task_specific`, `on_demand`, `dormant`)

These fields are also maintained in `metadata.json` for backward compatibility and internal use.

## Creating New Skills

When using the skill creator workflow, skills are automatically created with compliant frontmatter:

```bash
# Create a skill via the API workflow
uv run skill-fleet create "Create a Python async programming skill"
```

The generated SKILL.md will include:
- ✅ Valid YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Kebab-case name
- ✅ Appropriate description
- ✅ Extended metadata

### Skill Creation Workflow

The skill creation process follows a three-phase workflow:

1. **Understanding Phase**: Gathers requirements, analyzes intent, finds taxonomy path, analyzes dependencies
2. **Generation Phase**: Creates skill content using templates and structured generation
3. **Validation Phase**: Validates compliance, assesses quality, and refines if needed

This workflow is orchestrated by the workflows in `src/skill_fleet/core/workflows/skill_creation/`.

### Template Updates

The SKILL.md template (`src/skill_fleet/config/templates/SKILL_md_template.md`) now includes frontmatter placeholders:

```markdown
---
name: {{skill_name_kebab}}
description: {{description}}
metadata:
  skill_id: {{skill_id}}
  version: {{version}}
  type: {{type}}
  weight: {{weight}}
---

# {{skill_name}}

## Benefits of Compliance

### Interoperability
- Skills can be shared across different agentskills.io-compliant systems
- Standard format enables tool integration

### Discoverability
- XML generation for agent context injection
- Machine-readable metadata for automated discovery
- Consistent naming for easier search

### Validation
- Automated checks ensure quality
- Prevents malformed skills from entering the taxonomy
- Reduces debugging time

### Maintainability
- Consistent structure across all skills
- Clear separation of metadata and content
- Version tracking in frontmatter

### Community
- Follows open specification
- Enables collaboration across projects
- Standard format familiar to other developers

## Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains backward compatibility:

- ✅ `metadata.json` files are preserved and updated
- ✅ Existing SKILL.md content is kept intact
- ✅ Extended metadata continues to work
- ✅ Non-frontmatter skills still load (with warnings)

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Migration Tool
Always migrate existing skills rather than manually editing:
```bash
uv run skill-fleet migrate
```

### 2. Validate After Creation
Check compliance after creating or modifying skills:
```bash
uv run skill-fleet validate-skill path/to/skill
```

### 3. Keep Descriptions Concise
- Aim for 50-200 characters when possible
- Front-load important information
- Use active voice

### 4. Use Meaningful Names
- Choose names that clearly indicate the skill's purpose
- Be specific: `python-async` not just `async`
- Use domain context: `fastapi-auth` not just `auth`

### 5. Maintain metadata.json
While frontmatter is the source of truth for agentskills.io compliance, `metadata.json` should be kept in sync for internal functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails with "Invalid JSON"
**Solution**: Fix syntax errors in `metadata.json` before migrating

### Issue: Name contains uppercase or underscores
**Solution**: The migration automatically converts to kebab-case. Run with `--dry-run` first to preview changes.

### Issue: Description too long (>1024 chars)
**Solution**: The migration truncates automatically, but manually edit for better quality. Detailed information belongs in the main SKILL.md content.

### Issue: Frontmatter already exists but is invalid
**Solution**: Migration will detect and replace invalid frontmatter. Use `--dry-run` to preview.

### Issue: XML generation shows paths instead of names
**Solution**: Ensure frontmatter is present. Run migration first.
