## Migration Checklist

If you have code using old import paths:

### From `core/dspy/` (Deleted)

- [ ] `from skill_fleet.core.dspy import configure_dspy` → `from skill_fleet.dspy import configure_dspy`
- [ ] `from skill_fleet.core.dspy.modules import ...` → `from skill_fleet.core.modules import ...`
- [ ] `from skill_fleet.core.dspy.signatures import ...` → `from skill_fleet.core.signatures import ...`
- [ ] `from skill_fleet.core.dspy.modules.workflows import TaskAnalysisOrchestrator` → `from skill_fleet.core.workflows.skill_creation import UnderstandingWorkflow`

### From `infrastructure/llm/` (Deleted)

- [ ] `from skill_fleet.infrastructure.llm import configure_dspy` → `from skill_fleet.dspy import configure_dspy`
- [ ] `from skill_fleet.infrastructure.llm.dspy_config import ...` → `from skill_fleet.dspy import ...`

### From `core/creator.py` (Deleted)

- [ ] `from skill_fleet.core.creator import TaxonomySkillCreator` → Use `SkillService` from `skill_fleet.api.services`

### From `onboarding/` (Deleted)

- [ ] `from skill_fleet.onboarding import SkillBootstrapper` → Feature removed, use API directly

## Troubleshooting

### Import Error: "No module named 'skill_fleet.core.dspy'"

The `core/dspy/` directory was deleted in the migration. Update your imports:

```python
# ❌ Wrong (old)
from skill_fleet.core.dspy import configure_dspy

# ✅ Correct (new)
from skill_fleet.dspy import configure_dspy
```

### Import Error: "No module named 'skill_fleet.infrastructure.llm'"

The `infrastructure/llm/` directory was deleted. Use the new location:

```python
# ❌ Wrong (old)
from skill_fleet.infrastructure.llm import configure_dspy

# ✅ Correct (new)
from skill_fleet.dspy import configure_dspy
```

### Import Error: "cannot import name 'TaskAnalysisOrchestrator'"

Orchestrators were replaced with Workflow classes:

```python
# ❌ Wrong (old)
from skill_fleet.core.dspy.modules.workflows import TaskAnalysisOrchestrator
orchestrator = TaskAnalysisOrchestrator()

# ✅ Correct (new)
from skill_fleet.core.workflows.skill_creation import UnderstandingWorkflow
workflow = UnderstandingWorkflow()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `skill_fleet.dspy`** for DSPy configuration
2. **Use workflows** for high-level operations
3. **Use modules directly** only when you need fine-grained control
4. **Use signatures** for type definitions, not business logic
5. **Import specific classes** rather than using `from module import *`
6. **Use type hints** with imported models

# Service Extension Guide

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-25

## Overview

This guide explains how to extend the Skills Fleet service layer with custom services, add new service methods, implement dependency injection patterns, and write tests for services.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
Services should be thin orchestrators that coordinate domain objects. Put business logic in domain entities, domain services, or specifications. Services are about workflow orchestration, not business rules.

## Service Architecture

### BaseService

All services inherit from `BaseService`, which provides:
