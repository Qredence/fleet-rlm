def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

In this example, `my_decorator` is a decorator function that takes a function `func` as an argument and returns a new function `wrapper`. The `@my_decorator` syntax above `say_hello` is equivalent to:

```python
say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)
```

When `say_hello()` is called, it actually executes the `wrapper()` function inside `my_decorator`.

# Logging with Decorators

One common use case for decorators is logging function calls. You can create a decorator that automatically logs when a function is called, along with its arguments and return value.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
