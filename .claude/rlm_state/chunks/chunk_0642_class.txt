class AnalyzeIntent(dspy.Signature):
    task_description: str = dspy.InputField()
    domain: str = dspy.OutputField()  # Too generic
    target_level: str = dspy.OutputField()  # No constraints
```

**Why**: Literal types constrain outputs at the type level, improving consistency and making invalid states unrepresentable.

### Add Quality Indicators to OutputField Descriptions

✅ **Good**:
```python
skill_content: str = dspy.OutputField(
    desc="Production-ready SKILL.md content with quality score >0.80, "
    "includes 3-5 concrete examples, copy-paste ready code snippets"
)
```

❌ **Bad**:
```python
skill_content: str = dspy.OutputField(
    desc="The content of the skill"
)
```

**Why**: Specific constraints guide the LM toward better outputs and align with evaluation metrics.

### Keep Docstrings Concise and Actionable

✅ **Good**:
```python
