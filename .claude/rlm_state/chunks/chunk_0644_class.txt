class GenerateSkill(dspy.Signature):
    """This signature is used to generate skill content. The skill should be
    comprehensive and include examples. It should follow best practices and be
    ready for production use. The content should be well-structured..."""

**Why**: LMs respond better to concise directives. Save verbose explanations for field descriptions.

## Training Data

### Aim for 50-100 Diverse Examples

✅ **Good**:
- 50 examples across 18 categories
- Mix of comprehensive (38), navigation_hub (11), minimal (1) styles
- Combination of golden (15) + extracted (9) + synthetic (26)

❌ **Bad**:
- 10-20 examples (insufficient)
- All from one category (not diverse)
- All one style (doesn't generalize)

**Why**: DSPy optimizers need 50-100 examples for robust optimization. Fewer examples lead to overfitting.

### Use Both Real and Synthetic Examples

```python
# Real examples (extracted from skills)
real_examples = extract_from_skills(skills_dir)

# Synthetic examples (for underrepresented categories)
synthetic_examples = generate_synthetic_examples(
    categories=["database", "architecture", "security"],
    count_per_category=3,
)

# Combine
trainset = real_examples + synthetic_examples
```

**Why**: Real examples provide grounding, synthetic examples fill gaps in category distribution.

### Validate Training Data Structure

```python
