    def __init__(self, host, port):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port

```

**Explanation:**

1.  The `singleton` decorator ensures that only one instance of the decorated class is created.
2.  It uses a dictionary `instances` to store the instances of the class.
3.  The `get_instance` function checks if an instance of the class already exists in the `instances` dictionary. If not, it creates a new instance and stores it in the dictionary.
4.  It then returns the instance.

**Output:**

```
Connecting to localhost:5432
True
```
