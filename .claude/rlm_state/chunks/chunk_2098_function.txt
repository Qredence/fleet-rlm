# Vibe Coding

## Purpose
Rapidly prototype modern web applications.

## When to Use This Skill
- You want to **rapidly prototype** a new web application.
- You're in a **creative flow** and want to build quickly.
- You prefer **local development** with full control.

## Key Principles
1. Research current best practices before implementing
2. Initialize properly with all necessary tooling
3. Build and test features incrementally
