    """
    Metric for factual correctness.

    Uses LLM to evaluate if prediction is factually correct
    based on the ground truth.

### 5. Use Consistent Thresholds

```python
# Define thresholds at module level
ACCURACY_THRESHOLD = 0.8
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7
LENGTH_MIN = 10
LENGTH_MAX = 1000
