def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

say_hello("David")
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `repeat` is a function that takes the `num_times` argument and returns a decorator function `my_decorator`.
2.  `my_decorator` takes the function to be decorated (`func`) and returns the `wrapper` function.
3.  The `wrapper` function executes the original function `num_times` times.
4.  The `@repeat(num_times=3)` syntax first calls `repeat(3)`, which returns the decorator function `my_decorator`. Then, it applies `my_decorator` to the `say_hello` function.

**Output:**

```
Hello, David!
Hello, David!
Hello, David!
```

# Decorators with State

Decorators can also maintain state. This can be useful for tasks such as counting the number of times a function has been called or caching the results of a function.

## Counting Function Calls
