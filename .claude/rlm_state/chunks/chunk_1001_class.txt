**API Endpoint**:
```
POST /api/v1/evaluation/adaptive-weights
Request: {
  "skill_style": "navigation_hub",
  "current_scores": {"semantic_f1": 0.8, "readability": 0.7},
  "context": {...}
}
Response: {
  "adjusted_weights": {...},
  "reasoning": "Navigation hubs emphasize clarity...",
  "expected_improvement": "15% on readability metric"
}
```

**Integration Points**:
1. Phase 3 validation: Detect style → adjust weights
2. Optimization pipeline: Use adjusted weights in metric function
3. Evaluation: Report both original and adjusted scores

**Files to Create**:
1. `src/skill_fleet/core/dspy/metrics/adaptive_weighting.py` (~200 lines)
2. Update `src/skill_fleet/core/dspy/signatures/phase3_validation.py`
3. Update `src/skill_fleet/api/routes/evaluation.py` with endpoint

**Timeline**: 1-2 days | **Impact**: 10-15% quality improvement per style category

#### **1C: Continuous Training Data Refinement** 📊

**Problem**: Fixed 50 examples; no feedback on which examples help optimizer. Low-quality examples limit optimization potential.

**Solution**: Track example effectiveness, intelligently sample for training.

**Implementation**:
- New module: `src/skill_fleet/config/training/manager.py`
  - Class: `TrainingDataManager`
  - Tracks: Which examples used in which optimizations, success rates
  - Methods: `score_examples()`, `filter_trainset()`, `identify_gaps()`
