#### Skill doesn't trigger

**Symptom:** Skill never loads automatically

*Fix:*
Revise your description field. See "The Description Field" for good/bad examples.

*Quick checklist:*
•  Is it too generic? ("Helps with projects" won't work)
•  Does it include trigger phrases users would actually say?
•  Does it mention relevant file types if applicable?

*Debugging approach:*
Ask Claude: "When would you use the [skill name] skill?" Claude will quote the description back. Adjust based on what's missing.
