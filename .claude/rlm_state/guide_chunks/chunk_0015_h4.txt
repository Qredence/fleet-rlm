#### Why this matters for your MCP users

**Without skills:**
•  Users connect your MCP but don't know what to do next
•  Support tickets asking "how do I do X with your integration"
•  Each conversation starts from scratch
•  Inconsistent results because users prompt differently each time
•  Users blame your connector when the real issue is workflow guidance

**With skills:**
•  Pre-built workflows activate automatically when needed
•  Consistent, reliable tool usage
•  Best practices embedded in every interaction
•  Lower learning curve for your integration
