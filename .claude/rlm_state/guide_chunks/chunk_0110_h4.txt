#### Large context issues

**Symptom:** Skill seems slow or responses degraded

*Causes:*
•  Skill content too large
•  Too many skills enabled simultaneously
•  All content loaded instead of progressive disclosure

*Solutions:*
**1.  Optimize SKILL.md size**
    – Move detailed docs to `references/`
    – Link to `references` instead of inline
    – Keep `SKILL.md` under 5,000 words

**2.  Reduce enabled skills**
    – Evaluate if you have more than 20 - 50 skills enabled simultaneously
    – Recommend selective enablement
    – Consider skill "packs" for related capabilities
