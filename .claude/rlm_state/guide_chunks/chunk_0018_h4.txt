#### Good use case definition:

**Use Case:** Project Sprint Planning
**Trigger:** User says "help me plan this sprint" or "create sprint tasks"

**Steps:**
1. Fetch current project status from Linear (via MCP)
2. Analyze team velocity and capacity
3. Suggest task prioritization
4. Create tasks in Linear with proper labels and estimates

**Result:** Fully planned sprint with tasks created

**Ask yourself:**
•  What does a user want to accomplish?
•  What multi-step workflows does this require?
•  Which tools are needed (built-in or MCP?)
•  What domain knowledge or best practices should be embedded?
