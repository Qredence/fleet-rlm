#### 1. Triggering tests

**Goal:** Ensure your skill loads at the right times.

**Test cases:**
•   ✅  Triggers on obvious tasks
•   ✅  Triggers on paraphrased requests
•   ❌  Doesn't trigger on unrelated topics

**Example test suite:**
**Should trigger:**
- "Help me set up a new ProjectHub workspace"
- "I need to create a project in ProjectHub"
- "Initialize a ProjectHub project for Q4 planning"

**Should NOT trigger:**
- "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
- "Help me write Python code"
- "Create a spreadsheet" (unless ProjectHub skill handles sheets)
