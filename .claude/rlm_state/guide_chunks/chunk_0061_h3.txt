### Using skills via API

For programmatic use cases - such as building applications, agents, or automated workflows that leverage skills - the API provides direct control over skill management and execution.

**Key capabilities:**
•   `/v1/skills` endpoint for listing and managing skills
•  Add skills to Messages API requests via the `container.skills` parameter
•  Version control and management through the Claude Console
•  Works with the Claude Agent SDK for building custom agents

**When to use skills via the API vs. Claude.ai:**

| Use Case | Best Surface |
| :--- | :--- |
| End users interacting with skills directly | Claude.ai / Claude Code |
| Manual testing and iteration during development | Claude.ai / Claude Code |
| Individual, ad-hoc workflows | Claude.ai / Claude Code |
| Applications using skills programmatically | API |
| Production deployments at scale | API |
| Automated pipelines and agent systems | API |

**Note:** Skills in the API require the Code Execution Tool beta, which provides the secure environment skills need to run.

•  Create Custom skills
•  Skills in the Agent SDK
