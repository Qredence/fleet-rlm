### Positioning your skill

How you describe your skill determines whether users understand its value and actually try it. When writing about your skill—in your README, documentation, or marketing - keep these principles in mind.

**Focus on outcomes, not features:**

✅  **Good:**
"The ProjectHub skill enables teams to set up complete project workspaces in seconds — including pages, databases, and templates — instead of spending 30 minutes on manual setup."

❌  **Bad:**
"The ProjectHub skill is a folder containing YAML frontmatter and Markdown instructions that calls our MCP server tools."

**Highlight the MCP + skills story:**
"Our MCP server gives Claude access to your Linear projects. Our skills teach Claude your team's sprint planning workflow. Together, they enable AI-powered project management."
