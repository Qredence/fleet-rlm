## Chapter 3: Testing and iteration

Skills can be tested at varying levels of rigor depending on your needs:

•  **Manual testing in Claude.ai** - Run queries directly and observe behavior. Fast iteration, no setup required.
•  **Scripted testing in Claude Code** - Automate test cases for repeatable validation across changes.
•  **Programmatic testing via skills API** - Build evaluation suites that run systematically against defined test sets.

Choose the approach that matches your quality requirements and the visibility of your skill. A skill used internally by a small team has different testing needs than one deployed to thousands of enterprise users.

**Pro Tip: Iterate on a single task before expanding**
We’ve found that the most effective skill creators iterate on a single challenging task until Claude succeeds, then extract the winning approach into a skill. This leverages Claude’s in-context learning and provides faster signal than broad testing. Once you have a working foundation, expand to multiple test cases for coverage.
