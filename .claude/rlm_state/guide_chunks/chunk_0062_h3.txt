### Recommended approach today

Start by hosting your skill on GitHub with a public repo, clear README (for human visitors — this is separate from your skill folder, which should not contain a README.md), and example usage with screenshots. Then add a section to your MCP documentation that links to the skill, explains why using both together is valuable, and provides a quick-start guide.
