### Using the skill-creator skill

The `skill-creator` skill - available in Claude.ai via plugin directory or download for Claude Code - can help you build and iterate on skills. If you have an MCP server and know your top 2–3 workflows, you can build and test a functional skill in a single sitting - often in 15–30 minutes.

**Creating skills:**
•  Generate skills from natural language descriptions
•  Produce properly formatted SKILL.md with frontmatter
•  Suggest trigger phrases and structure

**Reviewing skills:**
•  Flag common issues (vague descriptions, missing triggers, structural problems)
•  Identify potential over/under-triggering risks
•  Suggest test cases based on the skill's stated purpose

**To use:** "Use the skill-creator skill to help me build a skill for [your use case]"

**Note:** `skill-creator` helps you design and refine skills but does not execute automated test suites or produce quantitative evaluation results.
