## Introduction

A skill is a set of instructions - packaged as a simple folder - that teaches Claude how to handle specific tasks or workflows. Skills are one of the most powerful ways to customize Claude for your specific needs. Instead of re-explaining your preferences, processes, and domain expertise in every conversation, skills let you teach Claude once and benefit every time.

Skills are powerful when you have repeatable workflows: generating frontend designs from specs, conducting research with consistent methodology, creating documents that follow your team's style guide, or orchestrating multi-step processes. They work well with Claude's built-in capabilities like code execution and document creation. For those building MCP integrations, skills add another powerful layer helping turn raw tool access into reliable, optimized workflows.

This guide covers everything you need to know to build effective skills - from planning and structure to testing and distribution. Whether you're building a skill for yourself, your team, or for the community, you'll find practical patterns and real-world examples throughout.
