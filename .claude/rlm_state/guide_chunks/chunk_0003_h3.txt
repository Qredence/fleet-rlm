### Two Paths Through This Guide

**Building standalone skills?** Focus on Fundamentals, Planning and Design, and category 1-2.
**Enhancing an MCP integration?** The "Skills + MCP" section and category 3 are for you. Both paths share the same technical requirements, but you choose what's relevant to your use case.

**What you'll get out of this guide:** By the end, you'll be able to build a functional skill in a single sitting. Expect about 15-30 minutes to build and test your first working skill using the skill-creator.

Let's get started.
