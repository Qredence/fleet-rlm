### Iteration based on feedback

Skills are living documents. Plan to iterate based on:

**Undertriggering signals:**
•  Skill doesn't load when it should
•  Users manually enabling it
•  Support questions about when to use it
**Solution:** Add more description and nuance to the description - this may include keywords particularly for technical terms

**Overtriggering signals:**
•  Skill loads for irrelevant queries
•  Users disabling it
•  Confusion about purpose
**Solution:** Add negative triggers, be more specific

**Execution issues:**
•  Inconsistent results
•  API call failures
•  User corrections needed
**Solution:** Improve instructions, add error handling
