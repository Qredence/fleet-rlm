#### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level system:

1.  **First level (YAML frontmatter):** Always loaded in Claude's system prompt. Provides just enough information for Claude to know when each skill should be used without loading all of it into context.
2.  **Second level (SKILL.md body):** Loaded when Claude thinks the skill is relevant to the current task. Contains the full instructions and guidance.
3.  **Third level (Linked files):** Additional files bundled within the skill directory that Claude can choose to navigate and discover only as needed.

This progressive disclosure minimizes token usage while maintaining specialized expertise.
