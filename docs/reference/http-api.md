There is no caller authentication. The service binds to loopback by default;
binding elsewhere does not add authentication. Only use on a trusted host or
behind a separately secured boundary.

Model selection accepts `{"role":"root","model":"openai/system.ai.service"}`.
The service must appear in discovery for its catalog/schema. Selection is
session-scoped; a busy turn returns 409, an inaccessible/non-chat model returns
422, and discovery/persistence failures return a sanitized 503 without replacing
the current engine. Model, mode, and context settings survive independent updates
and server restart. Operator-owned secrets and resource limits are not writable
through this endpoint. Accessible metadata does not guarantee inference readiness.

## Attach a file

Send a `multipart/form-data` body with a `file` field. The upload limit is
controlled by `FLEET_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` (default 25,000,000 bytes). The response
contains the mounted path and relative workspace path, for example
`/workspace/files/input.csv` and `files/input.csv`.

## Run a Turn

The JSON request has one required `task` string:

```json
{"task":"Summarize the attached CSV and verify the totals with Python.","idempotency_key":"ledger-review-1"}
```

The response uses `text/event-stream`. Each data event is JSON prefixed by
`data: ` and separated by a blank line. The server initially emits a
`turn_status` preparation event, then DSPy callback events such as
`module_start`, `lm_end`, `tool_start`, and `tool_end`. An `lm_end` event carries a `usage` object with
numeric `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`, and, when the provider reports them,
`reasoning_tokens`; it is omitted when the provider reports no usage. Completion is reported as
`turn_complete` with `answer`, `route`, optional `learned_skill_note`, and an
`artifacts` list. When MLflow tracing is configured, the completion event also
includes the recorded `trace_id`. Failures produce a sanitized `error` event
(which also carries the `trace_id` when tracing is configured) followed by stream completion. The connection may emit SSE comment keep-alives.

Sessions serialize their own Turns while a run is in progress. Session IDs are
validated by the runtime; use simple URL-safe identifiers.
An optional idempotency key persists intent before execution. Completed requests
replay their recorded outcome; failed/uncertain requests do not replay side effects.
Replay outcome events carry the original persisted `turn_id`, so the status route
can recover that same outcome rather than looking up the retry's preparation ID.
A completed outcome commits in the same transaction as files and turn history;
a lost response or later delivery failure cannot downgrade that durable completion.
A PostgreSQL advisory lease rejects a second worker owning the same session.

Events include `version`, `session_id`, `turn_id`, agent/parent/sandbox IDs,
monotonic per-stream `seq`, timestamp, and `payload`. Flat payload fields remain
for compatibility. Generated code, bounded outputs, allocation/deletion, routing,
and call-budget events are available. Queues apply producer backpressure.
Module/model/tool activity has paired `*_start` and `*_end` events with `call_id`;
DSPy callbacks also include `parent_call_id`. End events report `ok`, `error_type`,
and `duration_ms`. Tool `inputs` and `output` are bounded, redacted text previews;
`source` distinguishes `dspy` callbacks from `sandbox_bridge` operations. These
may be nested observations, not additional model calls. Predictor payloads are
omitted rather than exposing private reasoning. Previews redact sensitive keys
and labelled credentials but cannot detect every secret in arbitrary text.
`repl_code`/`repl_output` share an `execution_id`, namespace, and `phase`
(`bootstrap` or `task`); output includes timing, stdout/stderr, a bounded `value`
preview, and error status. `triage_decision.summary` describes the selected route
or enforced fallback; it is not a model's private chain-of-thought. These are
live activity events, not a durable replay log; `/history` retains turn outcomes.
Long-running Python and host-tool calls have no independent 120-second bridge
or 180-second execution-read limit. They wait for completion or cancellation;
the shared `FLEET_TURN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` watchdog still bounds the whole turn.
Closing a stream requests remote cancellation; it does not merely abandon a
local Python future. Reconnection is not an automatic side-effect retry.

Workspace writes accept exactly one of `content` (UTF-8 text) or
`content_base64`. Reads return bytes with an attachment disposition. Mode and
dataset selection persist across server restarts. Dataset hashes are checked
again at execution, so changing a source requires selecting its new revision.
Memory writes accept `content`, `kind`, source path-to-digest mappings, and an
explicit `reviewed` flag; only reviewed retrieval is included as turn evidence.
Stale memory remains labeled rather than being treated as newly verified data.

## Skills and files

`GET /skills` and `POST /skills/pull` accept an optional `session_id` query
parameter, defaulting to `default`. Local user Skills are read from
`.fleet/skills/` by default. Developer skills in `.agents/skills/` are not
synced as user Skills.

`GET /sessions/{session_id}/files` returns `files` and an `artifacts` subset;
it does not download file contents. The workspace is session-scoped on Daytona
and persisted through the Postgres VFS.
